```

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/LMS.git
   cd LMS
   ```
3. **Set up your development environment** by following the [Installation Guide](../user-guide/installation.md)
4. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Development Workflow

### Coding Standards

- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for Python code
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Include docstrings for all functions, classes, and modules
- Write unit tests for new functionality

### Docstring Format

Use Google-style docstrings for Python code:

```python
def function_name(param1, param2):
    """Short description of function.
    
    Longer description of function explaining details.
    
    Args:
        param1: Description of param1
        param2: Description of param2
        
    Returns:
        Description of return value
        
    Raises:
        ExceptionType: Description of when this exception is raised
    """
    # Function implementation
```

### Testing

- Write tests for all new features and bug fixes
- Run tests before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```

## Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** for any new features or changes
2. **Run all tests** to ensure they pass
3. **Submit a pull request** to the main repository
4. **Address any feedback** from code reviews

## Commit Message Guidelines

Follow the conventional commits specification for commit messages:

- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation only changes
- **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- **perf**: A code change that improves performance
- **test**: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example:
```
feat(auth): add password reset functionality
```

## Documentation

When adding or modifying features, make sure to update the documentation:

1. Update relevant documentation in the `/docs` directory
2. Include clear docstrings in your code
3. Add comments for complex logic

## Code Review Process

All submissions require review before being merged:

1. A maintainer will review your pull request
2. Changes may be requested
3. Once approved, your changes will be merged

## Development Environment Setup

For a consistent development environment:

1. Use a virtual environment
2. Install development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```
3. Install pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```
