2. Implement actual user authentication system

## Conclusion
The EduNova website meets all the requirements specified in the project brief. It provides a comprehensive higher education platform with LMS and e-commerce functionality, designed with Apple-inspired aesthetics for the target audience of individuals in their 20s and 30s. The website is fully responsive and functions correctly across different devices and browsers.

The website is ready for deployment, with the understanding that the mock services (payment processing, authentication, etc.) would need to be replaced with actual services in a production environment.
